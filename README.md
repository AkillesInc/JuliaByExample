Julia By Example
==============

Unofficial collection of Julia (Julia Lang) Examples, created by (Samuel Colvin)[http://www.scolvin.com].

[Julia](http://www.julialang.org) is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing. 

Because Julia is young there are reletively limited resources to help you get started with it. This site contains a series of simple examples of Julia performing common tasks like printing to stdout, reading from stdin, reading files, declaring functions, plotting etc. etc. It also replicates all the examples from the Julia source code with some explanation.

These examples are tested with the latest version of Julia 0.3 and the sources examples come from the head of the master branch of Julia.

There are some other useful resources, including:

* [Julia - Learn X in Y minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/)
* [Julia Documentation - latest 0.3 version](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/), including:
  * [Julia Manual](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/)
  * [Documentation on the Julia Standard Library](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/)

I am not an expert in Julia and this is a work in progress: there are almost certainly mistakes in, and obvious omissions from the examples. All files are hosted on **[GitHub](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/JuliaByExample)**: If you spot a problem **Create an issue** if you have a fix for a problem or want to add to the examples **Submit a pull request**.

The site can be build using `python _gen_site/generate.py`.
